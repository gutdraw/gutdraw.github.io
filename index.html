<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>
<em>Taxation is a power held by the legislative branch, not the executive branch however presidential candidates are often asked to purpose a tax plan. Here is mine:</em><br><br>
Federal Revenues as a percentage of GDP cannot be expected to deviate far from the historical par of 17.5%. 
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S" target="_blank">source</a><br>
Net Federal Outlays as a percentage of GDP cannot be expected to deviate far from the 2015 levels of 20.5%. 
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S" target="_blank">source</a><br>
This leaves an annual nominal deficit of 3% of GDP.  <br>
Current inflation trends would indicate a rate of 1% (roughly the current level) up to the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s target of 2% in the medium term.  <br>
This means Real GDP Growth (which excludes inflation) must be 2% to 1 % to prevent growth of national debit as a percentage of GDP. <br>
Current real GDP growth is somewhere around 1.4%. Accelerating growth rate will be required to reduce national debit as a percentage of GDP. <br>
Current corporate tax revenue is expected to be an estimated 2.5% of GDP in 2016, whereas personal income taxes are estimated at 8.7% of GDP for 2016.  
<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/source-revenue-share-gdp" target="_blank">source</a><br>
This means a roughly 5.8% increase in personal income tax revenue could offset a 20% reduction in corporate tax revenue.  <br>
<ul>
<li>Corporate tax rate should be reduced by a fifth (to 28% from 34% to 35%) offset by increases in personal tax rates of high earners to establish a revenue neutral change.</li>
</ul>
Because the top 2.7% of tax payers pay 51.6% of the personal income tax, personal taxes revenue should be increased in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>4% surcharge income tax on wages above $1 million</li>
<li>raising the investment income rate from 20% to 25%</li>
<li>carried interest income is treated as wages above $1 million</li> 
</ul>
Net corporate profits would increase; if those are distributed as dividends tax is recouped, if they are kept on the balance sheet the barrier to capital investment has been lowered by the tax rate reduction. <br>
<b>The intent of all of this is to increase monetary velocity and therefore growth.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Shift tax credits from special interests to working families</b>
<ul>
<li>Reduction/Removal of special interest tax breaks such as Alcohol Fuel Credit, Accelerated Depreciation, and <q>Title Passage Rule</q> excess foreign tax credits </li>
<li>Expand/Provide child care and educational expense tax credits</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="panel" id="panel3" style="display:none">
<h2>Federal Minimum Wage</h2>
<p>
<b>When the government pays benefits to those working full time, this is akin to a subsidy to the employing firm; labor costs are pushed from the firm to the government.</b><br>
Raising the FMW [Federal Minimum Wage] to lessen such occurrences is therefore a prudent action from a fiscally conservative standpoint if nothing else. I however feel there are other societal rationales as well.  
If firms require fulltime labor they must bear the costs of this labor and not expect the government to fill a gap between the firm&#8217;s expenditures vs the true payments to said labor. <br>
<br> 
138% of the FPL [Federal Poverty Level] is a threshold for Medicaid eligibility in many states.  In my view this level for a household of three should be the guide point for the FMW.  
In 2016 for a household of three 138% of the FPL is $27,724. <a href="https://www.parkviewmc.com/app/files/public/1484/2016-Poverty-Level-Chart.pdf">source</a>  There are 52 weeks in a year and 40 standard work hours per week; this would mean if we use the 138% threshold as a guide for the FMW, the hourly rate would be $13.33.  
By locking the FMW to the FPL it will adjust automatically each year. I would want this paired with my tax proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate; thereby lessening the inflation risks for such acute wage growth with reduced business costs from the lower tax rate. <br>
<br> 
Many have argued raising the FMW will depress hiring significantly.  I do not subscribe to such an argument; I feel it is expressed in inflation instead.  
The nature of Capitalism means firms already are hiring the minimum level of labor they can to run their firm;  I reject the notion a firm would hire <q>extra</q> staff because they are cheap.  
That is to say I feel the labor demand in the economy is for more inelastic with regard to price, than others argue. <br>
<br> 
Raising the FMW to reduce the collection of Federal Benefits of those working full time is a entitlements deficit reduction measure;  
in that it will not only lower net expenditures, but also increase net inflows of payroll taxes by rising aggregate wages.

<h2>Criminal Justice Reform</h2>
<p>
<em>
Much of the needed actions on Criminal Justice Reform will need to be conducted by the Congress and the States, however there is some actions as president I would take in combination with working with Congress<br>
In addition to working with other area of the government to reduce incarceration rates, end the war of drugs, eliminate private prisons, improve conditions for inmates, and invest in reentry programs the below actions would be taken intially with more to follow: 
</em>
<ul>
<li>Executive Order to the Department of Justice directing federal prosecutors not to pursue incarceration for non-violent drug charges</li>
<li>Executive Order to continue the ban on solitary confinement of juveniles and drastically reduce the use of solitary confinement for adults</li>
<li>Accelerate and expand the use of presidential clemency to address wrongs of the past in the criminal justice system </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="panel" id="panel5" style="display:none">
<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<p>
Climate Change is real, influenced by human activity, dangerous, and requires unparalleled international cooperation to address.  
Both the Republican Bush Administration [2008] and Democratic Obama Administration [2014] have pledged funding for the UN&#8217;s GCF [Green Climate Fund] and I would insist on this continued financial support. <br><br>
Unfortunately we are already past the point where slowing of emissions alone can reach our previously internationally committed goals from the Paris Agreement.  
<b>NETs [Negative Emission Technologies] will be required to prevent the most catastrophic scenarios.</b>  The U.S. as a world leader in innovation, research, and technology must take a leadership role in developing NETs.  
The funding for this should come from the revenue generated from drilling and mining on public lands which amounted to $9.6 Billion Dollar in FY2015. <a href="http://statistics.onrr.gov/ReportTool.aspx" target="_blank">source</a>  
Additionally the rate charged for lease on these public lands needs increased up to market rate oppose to the artificially low rate currently (a back door subsidy); 
royalty rates are also artificially low and need to be negotiated competitively in accordance with market rates.  
These advantageous rates no longer can be justified with the removal of crude oil export ban in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 and as our net energy imports approaches zero. <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=20812" target="_blank">source</a> <br><br>
With the additional revenue from public lands use I would love to see coal industry labor staff retrained in BECCS [Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage] as market forces push the nation away from coal 
(largely because of cheaper natural gas)  as an example of creating jobs and helping the environment simultaneously.

<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>
Healthcare in America is broken and has been for quite some time.  Additionally it must be recognized there is a fundamental problem with insurance, 
for it to be successful most of the people have to pay in more than they claim out; therefore even in a completely unregulated market it would still be a mechanism of redistribution of wealth from most healthy to least healthy.   <b>The ACA [Affordable Care Act] has pro and cons; anyone denying the existence of either is blinded by partisan bias.</b>  That said; I see the need for significant changes to healthcare in America. <br>
<b>Two Provisions I take issue with in the ACA are likely some of the least known; Transitional Reinsurance and Temporary Risk Corridors.</b>  They can be detailed <a href="http://www.actuary.org/files/ACA_Risk_Share_Fact_Sheet_FINAL120413.pdf" target="_blank">here</a><br>
In essence for the first three years of the ACA implementation the most profitable insurance firms would subsidize the most unprofitable insurance firms.  This is very flawed for many reason but some are:<br>
<ul>
<li>This causes a <q>cliff</q>, when this 3 year period ends, where the risk makeup of the insurance market changes significantly (2018)</li>
<li>This required government involvement in the actuarial calculations of insurance plans and the results compared to those predictions.  This is not an exact science and highly complex.</li>
<li>This creates a moral hazard where firms try to make <q>just enough</q> profit as to not have to pay into the subsidy fund.</li>
<li>These structures were to be neutral to the Federal Budget, but because of this mandate and actual profit loss results, the programs have not been able to deliver on its stated promises leading to lawsuits from insurers for lack of loss reimbursement payments.<a href="http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20161004/NEWS/161009979" target="_blank">source</a>  In my view this <q>broken promise</q> also played a role in many insurers leaving the insurance exchanges for 2017 insurance offerings.</li>
<li>These programs were all said to indirectly help Americans have more affordable insurance and better options, but in my view this was an assumption which lacks concrete and direct evidence.</li>
</ul>
<b>I would propose an alternative risk managing mechanism.</b> America has always rallied around those facing a catastrophe.  
Whether a tornado, hurricane, terror attack, or wild fires Federal Funds have been used knowing those in need would receive it.  
This concept needs to be applied in healthcare.  Catastrophic health insurance coverage (i.e. individual reinsurance) should be provided by the federal government.  
<b>If an individual has greater than $100K </b>(index to inflation with a factor for amount paid in benefits from the prior rolling 3 year period for future adjustment to this threshold) 
<b>in non-elective medical expenses paid/due to providers, the amount above $100k is paid by the Federal government oppose to the insurance firm.</b>  
Funding for such a benefit would come from reducing the tax credits currently provided for buying insurance from the ACA exchanges and capping the ESI [Employer Sponsored Insurance] tax exclusion as proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan&#8217;s Plan. <a href="http://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-HealthCare-PolicyPaper.pdf" target="_blank">source pg.15</a>  
To be clear I am not supporting the Speaker&#8217;s whole plan just this one aspect.  I also want to make clear this back-stop benefit is not Universal healthcare nor is it a <q>public option</q>. 
None the less this policy would reduce out of pocket costs for middle class Americans even with the reduction in tax credit due to the following:
 <ul>
<li>Reduced exposure to large losses by insurance firms leading to lower barriers to entry to the market and greater competition </li>
<li>Without having to pay for private reinsurance costs for insurance firms reduce</li>
<li>When combined with the existing 80/20 rule from the ACA (at least 80 of premiums collected must go to pay medical claims or refund checks must be paid to return to this ratio) health insures become low risk/ stable return businesses leading to lower cost of capital for the firm (similar to utilities)</li>
<li>Aggregate insurer paid medical claims drops which due to the 80/20 rule mean aggregate premium payments drop </li>
 </ul>

<b>Positive aspects of ACA which must be maintained:</b>
<ul>
<li>Non-Discrimination Provisions (i.e. women can&#8217;t be charged more for example)</li>
<li>Pre-existing Condition Coverage, in my view this means the individual mandate must also be maintained to prevent only gaining coverage after a health issue arises</li>
<li>Those under 26 can be covered on their parent&#8217;s plans</li>
<li>Ban on lifetime/annual limits</li>
<li>100% coverage of preventative services </li>
</ul>
 
<b>Additional negative aspects of ACA which need addressed:</b>
<ul>
<li>Removing the <q>Cadillac Tax</q> and replacing is with ESI exclusion capping as proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan.  More information on the <q>Cadillac Tax</q> <a href="http://www.cigna.com/health-care-reform/cadillac-tax" target="_blank">here</a></li>
<li>Rising the threshold for the employer mandate from 50 FTE [full-time equivalent employees] to 200 FTE</li>
<em>While the employer mandate seemed well intentioned in practice is has encouraged subcontracting and larger use of part time workers to stay below the 50 FTE threshold, and this is bad for American workers.  While this may still be somewhat true at a 200 FTE level firms of this greater size likely will have a higher value proposition for more stable and permanent staff in my view reducing the risk of moral hazard. </em>
</ul>

<b>Lastly another key to improving Healthcare in America is reducing the cost of services this should be done in the follow ways among others:</b>
<ul>
<li>Lower corporate tax rates as I propose in my tax plan, which will reduce cost of business for providers as well as insurers</li>
<li>Medical liability reform</li>
<li>Improvements to FDA regulation to reduce the cost of bring drugs and medical devices to market</li>
 </ul>
 I will be describing more of my plan to improve healthcare in America as the campaign progresses

<h2>Social Security</h2>
<p>
Social Security under current law is an unsustainable program headed to insolvency.  
Substantial changes will be required to ensure continuation of the program.  
Below I have outlined my 9 point plan which will restore social security to sustainability while also strengthening the protections of the program for the most vulnerable by establishing a minimum benefit at 125% of the federal poverty level as well as a built in increase of benefits across the board after 20 years to assist with the concerns of people outliving their retirement savings.  
The policy recommendations do call for a rising of the wage level applicable to social security payroll taxes; 
which for the employer are offset in some regard by my corporate tax rate reduction proposal and I pledge to seek offsetting reduction in Federal Income Taxes for the employee when I release my federal spending reduction proposal.  <br>
<br>
<b>Benefit Reductions:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Slow Benefit Growth for Top Half of Earners </li>
<ul>
<li>Enact the recommendations from the Simpson-Bowles Fiscal Commission Report to modify the benefit calculation to four brackets from three. Read more <a href="https://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/TheMomentofTruth12_1_2010.pdf" target="_blank">here pg.49</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Index Full Benefit Retirement Age to Longevity After it Reaches 67</li>
<li>Reduce Fraud and Overpayments for Social Security Disability Benefits</li>
<ul>
<li>Prevent dual collection of unemployment benefits and disability benefits, identify deceased beneficiaries to prevent improper continued payments, etc.  Read more <a href="http://oig.ssa.gov/newsroom/blog/july9-top-5-reasons-for-overpayments" target="_blank">here</a></li> 
</ul>
<li>Prohibit Applications for Social Security Disability Benefits above the Early Retirement Age and Instead Require Retiernment Social Security Draw</li>
</ul>
<b>Benefit Increases:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Create Minimum Benefit at 125% of Federal Poverty Level</li>
<li>Offer "Bump-Up" for Very Old Beneficiaries</li>
<ul>
<li>5% increase in benefits after 20 years or onset of disability</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>Revenue Increases:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Increase Payroll Tax by 0.2% (half paid by employer half paid by employee)</li>
<li>Subject 90% of Wages to Payroll Tax</li> 
<ul>
This would raise the cap from $118.5k annual wages to roughly $270k annual wages
</ul>
<li>Apply the Payroll Tax to "Cafeteria Plans" </li>
<ul>
<li>Remove the deduction of health care premiums, flex saving accounts, etc from  the payroll tax similar to 401k contribution which currently are still applicable for the payroll tax</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arms</h2>
<p>
<b>The U.S. Constitution recognizes an Unalienable Right to bear arms.</b><br>
This is true of other Unalienable Rights as well.  <br>
<br>
<b>By definition unalienable things cannot be taken away; you cannot take away the ability of someone to speak, to pray, or a human&#39;s ability to pick up an instrument and use it as an arm.<br>
That said this is different from claim of a right to ownership of any and all weapons.</b><br>
As few would argue against the need for nuclear arms requiring oversight, proper diligence, access protocols, etc.; it can be agreed other sophisticated and powerful arms may also require additional protocols to a simple stick; which as stated, cannot be prevented from becoming a club.<br>
<br>
Ubiquitous access to firearms by rational, well informed, trained/knowledgeable, citizen defenders of freedom is a foundation of the American Nation.  The American Experiment was and still is built upon a faith that the best path to freedom is when free people can determine their own path.  Unfortunately in this world the founding fathers knew this ideal could only be pursued when tyranny was fearful of liberty.<br>
<b>An armed citizenry has proven time and again as a sure and true backstop against tyranny.  If the U.S. provides arms to those pursuing their freedom against tyranny in foreign nations, if would be quite hypocritical to deny the value of arms in the battle against tyranny within our own borders.</b><br>
<b>If we can agree there is a balance of arms oversight and arms freedom which must be made for optimal utility value to society.  I think we can move forward without blinding partisanship.</b><br>
<br>
<b>It is very rare a rational individual choose to fire a gun at another human.</b><br>
In those rare instances it is often in response to an irrational situation (e.g. War) or an irrational individual (e.g. murderous psychopath).<br>
I would argue irrationality is incredible dangerous.    As we do not want irrational folks like Kim Jung Un processing nuclear arms, we do not want high power firearms in the hands of irrational individuals.<br>
<br>
<b>A Well-Regulated Militia</b><br>
<b>In the constitution it envisions regulations about a militia, so Legislature regarding arms of a military level of strength is to be expected; </b>otherwise tyranny of citizenry to other citizenry becomes an issue.<br>
If the US works to not have unaccounted for weapons of mass destruction that can fall into irrational hands with regard to foreign policy, it would stand to reason we could apply such accounting principles to our domestic arm policy.  


</p>
<b>Policy</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Continue and strengthen international action to drasically dearm the earth; with greatest focus upon:<br>
<ul> 
<li>North Korea's Nuclear Arms Program</li>
<li>Syria</li>
<li>Israel's Nuclear Arms Program outside NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)</li>
<li>Iran's Nuclear Development</li>
<li>India and Pakistans Nuclear Programs outside NPT</li>
<li>Continued Reduction of Nuclear Arms held by those within NPT</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expand Funding for Gun Research by CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention)<br>
<ul>
<li>Only a highly transparent, defendable, data driven approach can build the broad concensus needed for progress. Therefore let us begin aggresivly collecting and reviewing data</li>
<li>Suicides by gun account for a large, if not majority, of gun deaths in America according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</li>
<li>Violance starts in the mind</li>
</ul></li>
