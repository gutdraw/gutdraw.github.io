</p>

<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>
<em>Taxation is a power held by the legislative branch, not the executive branch however presidential candidates are often asked to purpose a tax plan. Here is mine:</em><br><br>
Federal Revenues as a percentage of GDP cannot be expected to deviate far from the historical par of 17.5%. 
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S" target="_blank">source</a><br>
Net Federal Outlays as a percentage of GDP cannot be expected to deviate far from the 2015 levels of 20.5%. 
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S" target="_blank">source</a><br>
This leaves an annual nominal deficit of 3% of GDP.  <br>
Current inflation trends would indicate a rate of 1% (roughly the current level) up to the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s target of 2% in the medium term.  <br>
This means Real GDP Growth (which excludes inflation) must be 2% to 1 % to prevent growth of national debit as a percentage of GDP. <br>
Current real GDP growth is somewhere around 1.4%. Accelerating growth rate will be required to reduce national debit as a percentage of GDP. <br>
Current corporate tax revenue is expected to be an estimated 2.5% of GDP in 2016, whereas personal income taxes are estimated at 8.7% of GDP for 2016.  
<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/source-revenue-share-gdp" target="_blank">source</a><br>
This means a roughly 5.8% increase in personal income tax revenue could offset a 20% reduction in corporate tax revenue.  <br>
<ul>
<li>Corporate tax rate should be reduced by a fifth (to 28% from 34% to 35%) offset by increases in personal tax rates of high earners to establish a revenue neutral change.</li>
</ul>
Because the top 2.7% of tax payers pay 51.6% of the personal income tax, personal taxes revenue should be increased in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>4% surcharge income tax on wages above $1 million</li>
<li>raising the investment income rate from 20% to 25%</li>
<li>carried interest income is treated as wages above $1 million</li> 
</ul>
Net corporate profits would increase; if those are distributed as dividends tax is recouped, if they are kept on the balance sheet the barrier to capital investment has been lowered by the tax rate reduction. <br>
<b>The intent of all of this is to increase monetary velocity and therefore growth.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Shift tax credits from special interests to working families</b>
<ul>
<li>Reduction/Removal of special interest tax breaks such as Alcohol Fuel Credit, Accelerated Depreciation, and 'Title Passage Rule' excess foreign tax credits </li>
<li>Expand/Provide child care and educational expense tax credits</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Criminal Justice Reform</h2>
<p>
<em>
Much of the needed actions on Criminal Justice Reform will need to be conducted by the Congress and the States, however there is some actions as president I would take in combination with working with Congress<br>
In addition to working with other area of the government to reduce incarceration rates, end the war of drugs, eliminate private prisons, improve conditions for inmates, and invest in reentry programs the below actions would be taken intially with more to follow: 
</em>
<ul>
<li>Executive Order to the Department of Justice directing federal prosecutors not to pursue incarceration for non-violent drug charges.</li>
<li>Executive Order to continue the ban on solitary confinement of juviniles and drastically reduce the use of solitary confinement for adults</li>
<li>Accelerate and expand the use of presidential clemency to address wrongs of the past in the criminal justice system. </li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<p>
Climate Change is real, influenced by human activity, dangerous, and requires unparalleled international cooperation to address.  Both the Republican Bush Administration [2008] and Democratic Obama Administration [2014] have pledged funding for the UN&#8217;s GCF [Green Climate Fund] and I would insist on this continued financial support. <br><br>
Unfortunately we are already past the point where slowing of emissions alone can reach our previously internationally committed goals from the Paris Agreement.  <b>NETs [Negative Emission Technologies] will be required to prevent the most catastrophic scenarios.</b>  The U.S. as a world leader in innovation, research, and technology must take a leadership role in developing NETs.  The funding for this should come from the revenue generated from drilling and mining on public lands which amounted to $9.6 Billion Dollar in FY2015. <a href="http://statistics.onrr.gov/ReportTool.aspx" target="_blank">source</a>  Additionally the rate charged for lease on these public lands needs increased up to market rate oppose to the artificially low rate currently (a back door subsidy); royalty rates are also artificially low and need to be negotiated competitively in accordance with market rates.  These advantageous rates no longer can be justified with the removal of crude oil export ban in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 and as our net energy imports approaches zero. <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=20812" target="_blank">source</a> <br><br>
With the additional revenue from public lands use I would love to see coal industry labor staff retrained in BECCS [Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage] as market forces push the nation away from coal (largely because of cheaper natural gas)  as an example of creating jobs and helping the environment simultaneously.
