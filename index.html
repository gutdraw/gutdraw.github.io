</p>

<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>
<em>Taxation is a power held by the legislative branch, not the executive branch however presidential candidates are often asked to purpose a tax plan. Here is mine:</em><br><br>
Federal Revenues as a percentage of GDP cannot be expected to deviate far from the historical par of 17.5%.

Net Federal Outlays as a percentage of GDP cannot be expected to deviate far from the 2015 levels of 20.5%. 
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S" target="_blank">source</a><br>
This leaves an annual nominal deficit of 3% of GDP.  <br>
Current inflation trends would indicate a rate of 1% (roughly the current level) up to the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s target of 2% in the medium term.  <br>
This means Real GDP Growth (which excludes inflation) must be 2% to 1 % to prevent growth of national debit as a percentage of GDP. <br>
Current real GDP growth is somewhere around 1.4%. Accelerating growth rate will be required to reduce national debit as a percentage of GDP. 
<ul>
<li>Corporate tax rate should be reduced by a fifth (to 28% from 34% to 35%) offset by increases in personal tax rates to establish a revenue neutral change.</li>
</ul>
Current corporate tax revenue is expected to be an estimated 2.5% of GDP in 2016, whereas personal income taxes are estimated at 8.7% of GDP for 2016.  
<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/source-revenue-share-gdp" target="_blank">source</a><br>
This means a roughly 5.8% increase in personal income tax revenue could offset a 20% reduction in corporate tax revenue.  <br>
Because the top 2.7% of tax payers pay 51.6% of the personal income tax, personal taxes revenue should be increased in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>4% surcharge income tax on wages above $1million</li>
<li>raising the investment income rate from 20% to 25%</li>
<li>carried interest income is treated as wages above $1million</li> 
</ul>

Net corporate profits would increase; if those are distributed as dividends tax is recouped, if they are kept on the balance sheet the barrier to capital investment has been lowered by the tax rate reduction. <br>
<b>The intent of all of this is to increase monetary velocity and therefore growth.</b>
